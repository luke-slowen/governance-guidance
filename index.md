# Governance guidance
This site documents the governance standards and guidance that we expect teams working
across the public sector to follow when building digital services.

It complements the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and
is inspired by the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) and the
[Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/#moj-technical-guidance)


## Principles

{% assign principle_groups = site.pages
  | where: "principle", true %}

{% for principle in principle_groups %}
- [{{ principle.title }}]({{ principle.url | relative_url }})
{% endfor %}

## Standards

{% assign standard_groups = site.pages
  | where: "standard", true %}

{% for standard in standard_groups %}
- [{{ standard.title }}]({{ standard.url | relative_url }})
{% endfor %}

## Guides

{% assign guides = site.pages
  | where: "guide", true
  | group_by: "category" %}

{% for guide_group in guides %}
{% if guide_group.name != "" %}
### {{ guide_group.name }}
{% else %}
### General guides
{% endif %}

{% for guide in guide_group.items %}
- [{{ guide.title }}]({{ guide.url | relative_url }})
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

## Adding new guidance

Create a new Markdown file in the [Governance guidance repo](https://github.com/luke.slowen/governance-guidance) that follows this pattern, add a link to it
from this page, and make a pull request:

# Thing you're writing about

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why the thing you're
writing about is important. The [title should probably be a verb, not a
noun][good-services-are-verbs] (e.g. “Storing source code”, not “Code
repositories”).

## User needs

Why do we do this thing? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this thing?

## Tools

What specific bits of software (commercial or open source) do
we use to help us do this thing?
```

The service manual has some useful information on
[learning about and writing user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs).
