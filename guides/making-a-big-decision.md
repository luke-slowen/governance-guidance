You're deciding whether to shut something down, or scale it up

**Things you should be thinking aboutâ€¦**
- Cost, of the action and of the status quo
- Politics - what's the ministerial appetite?
- Have we captured all the information we need to make this Big Decision?

**Here are some good examples you could use**
- [Building Digital UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-digital-uk)
@ the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)
- [Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund]
