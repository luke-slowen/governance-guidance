# What should I look for to know the project is healthy?

- Youâ€™ll be shown the actual things that have been worked on. These could be
user research notes, sketches, rough mockups on screen, or even the real
evolving service.
- There should be discussion of how things link back to the user research,
and of how things will be tested with users.
- There should be good attendance from the team.
- The team should talk openly about their challenges as well as successes.
- People outside the team should be attending, including stakeholders and
representatives of user groups.
- There should also be mention of planned next steps.
