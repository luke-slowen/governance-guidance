# Governance Principles

(Draft, structure only)

These principles are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate.
Governance is a trade-off between competing pressures - these principles are
meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.

They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should
expect to be challenged if you go your own way. The principles are to guide future
and current governance - use your judgement, but in general, follow the principle of
'Minimum Viable Governance'.

Appropriate boards and forums within your organisation should review and agree
these principles on a 6 monthly basis.
